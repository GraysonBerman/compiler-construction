Quick links to BNFC installation instructions:

- [BNFC: basic installation instructions](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction/blob/master/BNFC-installation.md)
- [BNFC: adding the Java lexer and parser](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction/blob/master/BNFC-installation-java.md)
- [BNFC: self check](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction/blob/master/BNFC-example.md)

Lecture by Lecture:

- [Lecture 1.1](lecture-1.1.md): Organisation, Assessment, Short introduction to parsing  
- Lab 1.2: Discussion of [Assignment 1](https://hackmd.io/s/HyaDeaXzN#) (due Wed, Feb 6, see [Lecture 1.1](lecture-1.1.md) for details).

- [Lecture 1.3](https://hackmd.io/s/S110eS-VE#): How to implement a state machine and why do Java and Python not have gotos? **Homework:** Read the articles referenced in [the lecture](https://hackmd.io/s/S110eS-VE).

- [Lecture 2.1](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/slides/1-slides-ipl-book.pdf): A brief introduction to compiler construction from Chapter 1 of [the book](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/). **Homework:** Read [Chapter 1](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf).


- [Lecture 2.2](lecture-2.2.md): Determinstic Finite Automata. **Homework:** Exercise 2.2.4 (possibly 2.2.5 and 2.2.6) and Exercise 2.2.10 (possibly 2.2.11). These exercises are relevant for tests and final.

- Lecture 2.3: **How to build a compiler/interpreter in 50min**. We looked at the [slides](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/slides/2-slides-ipl-book.pdf) up to page 35, see also Chapter 2 of [the book](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf). For installation  introductions see the [BNFC homepage](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com) or my [BNFC installation instructions](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction/blob/master/BNFC-installation.md). **Homework:** First install Haskell (not necessary if you use the windows binaries), then install BNFC. *Deadline: Monday, Feb 11, before class* (If there are problems with installation we will try to sort it out on Monday in class.)

- Lab 3.1: The aim of the lab is for everybody to be able to replicate my [BNFC installation instructions](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction/blob/master/BNFC-installation.md). *From today on I will assume that everybody has bnfc installed and is able to run the calculator. Let me know if this is not the case.*

- Lecture 3.2: The aim of this lecture is to understand more about parsing. I link the grammars of [C](https://cs.wmich.edu/~gupta/teaching/cs4850/sumII06/The%20syntax%20of%20C%20in%20Backus-Naur%20form.htm) and [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-19.html). In the lecture we explained how the grammar of C-- of the [BNFC tutorial](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/tutorial/bnfc-tutorial.html) works. Then we started on Exercise 2 in  [BNFC self check](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction/blob/master/BNFC-example.md). Trying to find the bug in the program of Exercise 2 is **Homework** (to do before the class on Friday, Feb 15, when we will look at this together).

- Lecture 3.3: The aim of the coming labs/lectures is to finish the material of Chapter 2 in [the book](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf) and the [slides](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/slides/2-slides-ipl-book.pdf) and of the [BNFC tutorial](http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/tutorial/bnfc-tutorial.html). **Homework:**  [Install the Java lexer and parser](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction/blob/master/BNFC-installation-java.md) and finish Exercise 2 of the [BNFC self check](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction/blob/master/BNFC-example.md).

- Lab/Lecture 4.1: [Working towards Assignment 2](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/assignments/assignment1/assignment1.html).
[Install the Java lexer and parser](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction/blob/master/BNFC-installation-java.md).

- Lab/Lecture 4.2: [Working towards Assignment 2](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/assignments/assignment1/assignment1.html).
For those who missed this in class there is a **Homework:** Exercise 0 of the [BNFC self check](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction/blob/master/BNFC-example.md).

coming up soon:
